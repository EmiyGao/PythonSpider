    "Britain is moving closer to the nightmare Brexit scenario businesses have long feared.",
    "Boris Johnson has used his first days as prime minister to double down on his threat to leave the European Union on October 31, even without an exit agreement in place to protect trade. ",
    "The UK government is now working on the assumption that there won't be an agreement with EU officials, one of Johnson's top deputies ",
    "said",
    " over the weekend. A ",
    "government marketing campaign",
    " is meant to prepare the public. ",
    "The rhetoric drove the ",
    "British pound",
    " to its weakest level in more than two years on Monday. The currency dropped further on Tuesday, nearly breaking below $1.21. ",
    "Business continues to push back, arguing that a rupture with Britain's biggest export market would be deeply damaging. A ",
    "major lobby group warned",
    " that a disorderly Brexit would disrupt almost every part of the UK economy, and French carmaker PSA said new trade barriers could doom its factory near Liverpool.",
    "Investors are increasingly concerned that Johnson \"actually wants to go through with a hard Brexit, potentially even as his Plan A,\" said Esther Reichelt, a foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank. ",
    "Taking a hard line",
    "Business groups have long cautioned that a messy Brexit would be a disaster, disrupting the supply chains that run across Europe and potentially injecting panic into financial markets. ",
    "UK government estimates ",
    "show",
    " that GDP would shrink by at least 2% by the end of 2020, and the government would be forced to borrow an extra £30 billion ($37.4 billion) per year. UK stock markets would fall 5% and the pound could lose another 10% of its value.",
    "That Johnson's team appears to be preparing for it as a matter of course will only stoke those fears. ",
    "Michael Gove, the government minister Johnson has put in charge of planning for a \"no-deal\" Brexit, wrote in the Sunday Times that a messy exit is \"now a very real prospect.\" ",
    "Gove wrote that the UK government would press the European Union to renegotiate the deal it struck with Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. EU officials have repeatedly refused to do so. ",
    "\"We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not,\" said Gove. \"The prime minister has been crystal clear that means we must prepare to leave the EU without a deal.\" ",
    "UK foreign minister Dominic Raab added fuel to the fire on Monday, telling the BBC that the UK government is now \"turbo-charging\" preparations for a disorderly exit in light of the European Union's \"fairly stubborn\" stance.",
    "Their remarks came as the Confederation of British Industry, the UK's biggest business lobby, said that neither the United Kingdom nor the European Union is ready for \"no deal.\" ",
    "\"Although businesses have already spent billions on contingency planning for no deal, they remain hampered by unclear advice, timelines, cost and complexity,\" the group said in a report.",
    "PSA, the French automaker that manufactures ",
    "Peugeot",
    " ",
    "(",
    "PUGOY",
    ")",
    ", Vauxhall and Opel cars, confirmed Monday that the future of its Ellesmere Port near Liverpool depends on what happens with Brexit. ",
    "The next generation of the Vauxhall Astra car is set to be made both there and in Germany. But CEO Carlos Tavares ",
    "told the Financial Times",
    " that the company would move production from England to a plant in southern Europe if necessary.",
    "New pound low",
    "Sterling continues to sink in this environment. On Monday, it fell 1% to its lowest price against the dollar since March 2017 and weakened against every G10 currency.",
    "\"Concerns over the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union with no Brexit deal in place is clearly haunting investor attraction towards [the pound],\" said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at currency broker FXTM.",
    "Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note this month that the pound could fall to between $1.00 and $1.10 if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal. It could trade between $1.10 and $1.20 if Johnson",
    " ",
    "takes a tough negotiating stance with Europe, they added.",
    "A sharp decline in the value of the pound could cause inflation to spike, hurting consumers. And while it might help exporters, a collapsing currency could scare off foreign investors and make life difficult for British companies that have to make payments in dollars."

    "President Donald Trump's ",
    "escalating trade war",
    " against China threatens to inflict a powerful shock to the American economy that not even the Federal Reserve can fully absorb. ",
    "The Fed cut interest rates this week for the ",
    "first time in nearly 11 years",
    ", effectively lowering the odds of a recession in the United States. Just 24 hours later, Trump ",
    "raised those odds",
    " by vowing to unleash tariffs on $300 billion of US imports from China, which will ",
    "for the first time directly impact American shoppers.",
    "The new front in the trade war will only add to the downturn in manufacturing ",
    "spanning the globe",
    ". It will further dent shaky business confidence and could even puncture the optimism among consumers. In short, little good can come from these new tariffs — and the",
    " ensuing retaliation from Beijing.",
    "\"It could be incredibly damaging to the global economy. The risk of a recession has gone up because of the ratcheting up of the trade war,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ",
    "Trump ",
    "blindsided investors",
    " on Thursday by announcing an abrupt end to the trade truce between the United States and China. Although talks will continue, Trump tweeted that he plans to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining US imports from China. ",
    "US stocks plummeted on the tweet, a ",
    "selloff that deepened on Friday.",
    " Cash rushed into ultra-save government bonds, sending Treasury yields to multiyear lows. ",
    "\"That's telling me there is a lot of concern we are headed toward a significant global slowdown,\" Hooper said.",
    "Trump has also kept open the possibility that tariffs on China will go up to 25%.",
    "Consumer goods targeted",
    "Beyond the direct impact of the tariffs, the escalation in trade tensions risks dealing a sizable blow to business confidence. ",
    "The on-again, off-again nature of the trade war makes it difficult for CEOs to plan for the future. Instead of hiring workers and opening new factories, many companies may decide to sit on the sidelines.",
    "\"Tariff man is back and more dangerous than ever to our economy,\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.",
    "In an interview with CNN Business, Boockvar argued that the only thing keeping the United States out of a recession is the strength of consumer spending. ",
    "However, Trump's tariffs would impact a wide swath of consumer products, likely resulting in higher prices on items including apparel, footwear and electronics such as smartphones, laptops and tablets. ",
    "In 2018, 42% of apparel and 69% of footwear sold in the United States was imported from China, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. ",
    "\"This is going to damper consumer spending,\" Boockvar said. ",
    "If the tariffs go into effect, Boockvar said there is likely a greater than 50% chance the United States succumbs to a recession.",
    "How will China respond?",
    "It's possible that Trump, spooked by market turmoil, backs down on his latest tariff threat. Another possibility is that the looming tariffs force Beijing to make enough concessions to allow both sides to claim victory. In either case, that would be a huge positive for the economy.",
    "But some observers fear Trump's increased pressure on China will backfire, provoking retaliation that deepens the economic pressure. ",
    "\"Trump's gambit is unlikely to work,\" Michael Hirson, Eurasia Group's practice head of China and Northeast Asia, wrote in a note on Thursday. \"Chinese President Xi Jinping cannot afford the perception that he has been blackmailed into a deal by Trump.\"",
    "A spokesperson from China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that although China does not want a fight, the country \"will fight if necessary.\" The official said that China will have to \"take necessary countermeasures,\" but did not explain what that retaliation will be. ",
    "Beijing's options include firing back with tariffs of its own, restricting the supply of the rare-earth minerals that the global tech industry relies on, and devaluing the country's currency. ",
    "Piling onto the global factory slowdown",
    "Even before this week's trade escalation, the world's manufacturing industry was in a severe slowdown. ",
    "The Barclays global manufacturing confidence index dipped further into negative territory in July. Barclays said it's \"yet another warning of an ongoing global industrial recession.\"",
    "US factory activity tumbled in July to the weakest level in nearly three years.",
    "Many blame the trade war for the global manufacturing downturn, but that may only be partially true. ",
    "Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of Economic Research Institute, said the factory slowdown began before the trade war erupted in the spring of 2018.",
    "\"The trade war is entirely a negative. It is piling on top of the cyclical downturn,\" Achuthan said.",
    "In other words, the United States is self-inflicting a shock at a time when the global economy was already exposed. ",
    "\"People don't understand. We are slow walking toward a window of vulnerability. A negative shock we thought we could withstand becomes a recessionary shock,\" Achuthan said. \"We're definitely on recession watch.\"",
    "Others doubt that the 10% tariffs on China will be very destabilizing because the Federal Reserve is coming to the rescue with more easy money.",
    "\"The risk to growth is somewhat small,\" said Aditya Bhave, senior global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, pointing to the Fed's rate cuts as a cushion.",
    "Risk of a 'feedback loop'",
    "Some have speculated that Trump is escalating the trade war to get the Fed to listen to his pleas for lower interest rates. ",
    "That would be a risky gamble because there is no guarantee the Fed will act, nor that the rate cuts will work.",
    "\"It simply makes no sense to risk a global recession in order to get the Fed to cut rates,\" Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.",
    "Bhave said it's possible Trump turned up the heat on China because he feels emboldened by the Fed's rate cuts.",
    "\"We think the Fed is inadvertently encouraging a more hawkish stance on trade,\" he said. ",
    "Wall Street is ",
    "already pricing in",
    " the chances of more rate cuts later this year in response to the spike in trade tensions. ",
    "\"There is a risk we get stuck in a feedback loop,\" Bhave said. \"The Fed keeps cutting rates, trade policy keeps getting more hawkish and the Fed runs out of ammunition to fight the next recession.\""

    "big loser",
    ".",
    "The tariffs could knock down iPhone sales by between 6 million and 8 million in the United States next year, said technology analyst Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, in a note to investors Friday. That could cut Apple's earnings by 4% in 2020.",
    "President Donald Trump on Thursday ",
    "threatened a 10% tariff",
    " on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese goods that are not currently subject to tariffs. Those goods, which will include laptops, smartphones and other technology, will ",
    "hit the American tech industry",
    " particularly hard.",
    "The tariff threat \"brought back a dark cloud over Cupertino,\" said Ives. He called the tariffs a \"gut punch for Apple.\"",
    "\"Apple is clearly caught in the crossfires between DC and Beijing,\" said Ives, who called ",
    "Apple",

    " \"the poster child\" for the trade war.",
    "Wall Street continues to worry that the trade war could significantly increase the cost of iPhones around the world. Apple's stock fell 2% Thursday and is down another 1% Friday.",
    "Although Ives believes Apple will be able to mitigate some of the cost increases from tariffs by adjusting its supply chain, the process is slow-going. Apple may be able to move between 5% and 7% of iPhone production to India and Vietnam over the next two years if the tariff situation spirals, he said.",
    "But Apple couldn't abandon China entirely, and iPhone customers will be left paying more, delaying their purchases or looking for a different kind of smartphone",
    "The timing of the new tariffs is rough for Apple. The company just reported ",
    "better-than-expected earnings",
    ", and Wall Street cheered CEO Tim Cook's statement that Apple was quickly turning around its fortunes in China by cutting iPhone prices in the region. Ives noted Apple is in a critical period as it scrambles to gain customers in China. ",
    "The trade war throws a wrench into those gears."

    "Prices for those and other Chinese-made products might go up after September 1, when President Donald Trump says he will put ",
    "new tariffs on another $300 billion of imports from China. ",
    "The new round of duties could hit American consumers harder than a first round of tariffs imposed by Trump last year, which mostly hit industrial materials rather than everyday goods. ",
    "What could get more expensive?",
    "Shoppers could see the price of consumer electronics, clothing, shoes, and toys go up because American businesses import a significant portion of those goods sold in the United States from China. ",
    "Smartphones",
    ", laptops and tablets, desktop computers, video game consoles, TVs and digital cameras are all on the tariff list. ",
    "About 42% of apparel sold in the United States would be hit with the tariff, as well as nearly 70% of all footwear, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. ",
    "New Balance, for example, has warned ",
    "that the tariffs could even make the sneakers it manufactures in the United States more expensive because it needs to import component parts from China that are no longer made domestically. ",
    "The tariff could also raise the price of some of the upcoming holiday season's most popular toys, which are typically shipped into the country in August and September, said Toy Association President Stephen Pasierb.",
    "About 85% of the toys sold in the United States are made in China, including the top-selling L.O.L. Surprise doll. Toy giant ",

    "fish",
    ", and ",
    "Bibles",
    " would also get hit. ",
    "Who pays the tariff?",
    "As he has many times before, ",
    "Trump on Thursday claimed",
    " — falsely — that the tariffs have cost China rather than American consumers.",
    "\"We're taking in many billions of dollars. There's been absolutely no inflation and frankly it hasn't cost our consumer anything. It cost China,\" Trump said in remarks to reporters at the White House, adding that companies are now moving out of China to avoid the tariffs.",
    "But economic studies",
    " show that US consumers, not China, are bearing the weight of the duties. The White House's most recent Economic Report of the President, released in March, acknowledged that any benefit from the tariffs is offset by \"costs paid by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced consumption.\"",
    "Some US companies are moving production out of China to avoid paying the tariff. But instead of moving back to the United States, they usually move elsewhere in Asia. Imports have significantly increased this year from ",
    "Vietnam, Taiwan, Bangladesh and South Korea. ",
    "For those American businesses that don't move out of China — a process that could take months, if not years — they must decide how much of the added tariff cost to absorb and how much to pass on to consumers. ",
    "What happens next?",
    "Trade negotiations are ongoing and Trump could opt to hold off on putting new tariffs in place in September. He first threatened to impose the additional taxes in May, and then said the threat was off the table after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June. ",
    "But this week he reversed course again, after his trade team returned from talks in Shanghai. ",
    "The president wasn't pleased ",
    "that China had not offered concrete promises to purchase American agricultural products during the talks.",
    "Trump said Thursday that the new tariff would start at 10%, but could eventually go up. ",
    "\"It can be lifted in stages so we're starting at 10% and it can be lifted up to well beyond 25%,\" the President said. \"But we're not looking to do that, necessarily.\"",
    "Walmart, Costco, Target, and hundreds of other companies have asked the White House to remove existing tariffs and said that new taxes would have a \"",
    "significant, negative, and long-term",
    ",\" impact on American families and businesses.  ",
    "One ",
    "report",
    " estimates that the tariffs are already costing the typical US household more than $1,200 a year — even before new tariffs might be levied in September. When Trump increased tariffs in May, it hit some consumer goods including ",
    "luggage, bikes, handbags, hats and baseball gloves."

    " a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of goods",
    ", effectively taxing all Chinese exports to the United States. Beijing said it was ",
    "ready for a fight",
    ". ",
    "\"China will have to take necessary counter-measures,\" a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, adding that \"all the consequences will be borne by the US.\"",
    "Beijing may be able to cope with the fallout from an escalating fight between the world's two biggest economics, but it faces more constraints than Washington and will have to calibrate retaliation carefully.",
    "China \"basically has very few good options,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. \"In terms of directly hitting back at the US, it's quite difficult to do it without hurting themselves.\" ",
    "Here's what China could do next. ",
    "Hit back with tariffs",
    "China has previously fired back with tariffs of its own on goods from the United States. It responded to Trump's last escalation in May by ",
    "hiking duties on US goods",
    " worth $60 billion from 10% to 25%. ",
    "But China buys a lot less from the United States than it sells, meaning it has only $120 billion worth of goods to target. Washington can tax around $540 billion of Chinese imports.",
    "\"'China is likely to retaliate with a combination of tariff and non-tariff measures, given that it has a much shorter runway when it comes to tariffs,\" said Darren Tay, Asia country risk analyst at Fitch Solutions. ",
    "And most of the American exports China hasn't yet targeted are high-tech products that can't easily be substituted, according to Evans-Pritchard. ",
    "\"It will be partly inflicting pain on themselves to impose tariffs on many of those products,\" he added. ",
    "Restrict rare earths supply",
    "One of China's advantages in the trade war is its near monopoly on a group of minerals that the global tech industry can't live without. ",
    "China ",
    "controls more than 90% of the global production",
    " of rare earths, 17 minerals with magnetic and conductive properties that power most electronic devices. It also accounted for 80% of all rare earth minerals imported by the United States between 2014 and 2017.",
    "Beijing has been shoring up its rare earth industry recently and issuing thinly-veiled threats that it could curb exports of the minerals. Chinese state media published a commentary two months ago with the words: \"Don't say we didn't warn you.\" ",
    "\"That probably would have a bigger impact in the short run, but it would do a lot of collateral damage to China's other trading partners, particularly Japan, which is the primary importer of rare earth minerals,\" Evans-Pritchard said.",
    "Rare earth stocks in Asia ",
    "soared on Friday",
    " hours after Trump announced the new tariffs, with investors speculating that prices could go up if China restricts supply.",
    "Devalue the yuan ",
    "China's currency, the yuan, has gotten ",
    "caught up in trade battles",
    " with the United States in the past, prompting accusations from Trump that Beijing was artificially lowering its value to",
    " ",
    "help its exporters.",
    "The yuan doesn't trade freely like other major currencies such as the dollar and the pound. Every day, China's central bank sets a \"band\" which limits movements in the yuan's value to 2% up or down. ",
    "The Chinese currency ",
    "slumped on Friday",
    " against the dollar, both in Shanghai and on the offshore market where it moves more freely.",
    " ",
    "In China, one dollar now buys about 6.94 yuan. Outside of China, the currency fell to a 2019 low of nearly 6.98 before recovering slightly.",
    "A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports cheaper, helping cushion the impact of US tariffs.",
    "\"I think the best tool they have, the most powerful tool they have, is the exchange rate,\" Evans-Pritchard said. \"That's really a tool that would allow them to directly offset quite a lot of the impact of the tariffs.\"",
    "But China has reasons not to devalue the yuan — a big drop in the currency could ",
    "spark an outflow of money from China",
    " and hurt economic stability. ",
    "\"Beijing would want to avoid a repeat of 2015 when devaluation set off a crisis of confidence in the yuan,\" said Tay, of Fitch Solutions, referring to a ",
    "previous move lower ",
    "that led to accusations that China was starting a ",
    "\"currency war.\" ",
    "Another reason for China not to use its currency as a weapon, according to Evans-Pritchard, is that it could be the nuclear option.",
    " ",
    "\"The problem with using that tool is if they use it now, that's it basically. It's hard to see the trade negotiations not breaking down completely at that point,\" he said. ",
    "Make life harder for US companies",
    "Another way of tightening the screws on the Trump administration also carries risk. ",
    "Some of the biggest US companies, including ",
    "Apple",
    " ",

    "as some already have",

    "\"China's less reliant on foreign investment than it used to be, but it still is keen not to see multinationals shift out of the country en masse,\" Evans-Pritchard said. \"If you make life very hard for US firms operating in China then there's the risk you're shooting yourself in the foot to some degree.\"",

    " recently said that ongoing trade tensions with China and restrictions on selling to Huawei are weighing on their bottom lines and forecasts.",
    "\"Tariff and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customer supply chains,\" Intel CEO Bob Swan said on a conference call with shareholders on July 25. ",
    "Companies want ",
    "the White House to resolve the trade war.",
    " Instead, Trump said Thursday the United States would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods that were not already subject to tariffs. Those goods, which will include laptops, smartphones and other technology, will hit the chipmakers particularly hard.",
    "The Huawei ban threatens American businesses, too. Chipmakers have asked the Trump administration to allow sales to Huawei to resume. Last week, chief executives from seven US suppliers to Huawei met with Trump to discuss the restrictions. They included the CEOs of Qualcomm, ",
    "Google",

    "The Trump administration in May barred US firms from using Huawei telecom gear and from selling to the Chinese company. The US government fears Huawei's telecom equipment poses a national security threat, a claim Huawei denies. The administration ",
    "later added five additional Chinese companies",
    " to the same \"Entity List\" of banned businesses.",
    "Trump said in June he would relax the Huawei export ban, but",
    " there has been confusion",
    " on exactly what US suppliers will be able to ship and when. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said the government could begin responding next week to US companies requesting licenses to resume sales to Huawei, according to a ",
    "Reuters report",
    ". ",
    "But in the meantime, many of those companies fear their sales will suffer as a result of the restrictions and general trade uncertainty. ",
    "Chip companies fear future losses",
    "Qualcomm on Wednesday posted revenue of $4.9 billion for the quarter ending in June, down 13% from the same period in the prior year. The company said that was in part because Huawei, a major buyer of Qualcomm's chips for cell phones to be sold outside of China, has changed its business strategy in response to the export ban.",
    "Qualcomm also announced projected full-year chip shipments of between $140 million and $160 million, which would be a 31% to 40% decrease from the prior year. And CEO Steve Mollenkopf said the Huawei export ban is expected to continue to \"create headwinds\" in the next two quarters.",
    "AMD also had a challenging quarter. On Wednesday, it posted a 13% drop in revenue for the three months ending in June. ",
    "AMD was particularly hurt",
    " by the US government's additions to the Entity List in June, because three of the Chinese businesses added to it were part of a joint venture AMD has in China to license its microchip technology. ",
    "\"We have stopped shipping some products to a couple of our customers that are on the US Entity List and that is a little bit of a headwind into the second half of the year,\" AMD chief executive Lisa Su said on the earnings call. ",
    "Much of the potential impact of the Huawei export ban has not yet been realized, said Bank of America analyst Tal Liani. Huawei anticipated the ban and made additional purchases from US suppliers to build up its inventory, meaning the American companies got a bump in sales that mitigated declines. ",
    "\"Huawei built very high levels of inventory of components, so we have not seen any major impact as of yet,\" Liani said. \"But that's temporary.\" ",
    "Some American companies have resumed sales of select products to Huawei that they determined not to be covered by the export ban. ",
    "Micron was the first chip company ",
    "to announce it had done so",
    " during its earnings call last month. Still, the company's earnings in the three months ending May were dragged down by the inability to sell to Huawei. Huawei was previously Micron's top customer, and contributed 13% of its revenue in the first half of 2019. ",
    "Intel's Swan said during his company's earnings call last week that Intel has also restarted some shipments to Chinese companies that had been placed on the Entity List, though he did not mention Huawei by name. ",
    "But it's unclear whether those actions will be enough to completely stem losses if the export ban remains in place and trade tensions continue to fester. ",
    "\"Resolving the trade issues is very important for Huawei and also for the US companies,\" Liani said. "

    "electric car ",
    "charged while I'm on a ",
    "long road trip",
    "?",
    "Gas stations are everywhere. A typical highway exit might have several of them, each with banks of pumps at the ready. And the process is fast: Filling the tank takes just a few minutes. There's rarely any need to plan fueling stops ahead of time. When the tank is running low, it's just a matter of pulling off at the next exit, filling the tank, and getting back on the highway. Snacks, drinks and restrooms are usually available there, too.  ",
    "But there are far fewer electric car fast chargers along the highway. Also, despite advances in charger and battery technologies, it still takes much longer --  typically about 30 minutes with today's fast chargers -- to recharge a battery than to pump liquid into a tank. (That time will go down a lot in the future, but not for all cars or at all chargers.) ",
    "To make matters worse, EV fast chargers often aren't located near convenience stores or restaurants. So, while drivers have longer to wait, there's not much to do but sit in the car while it recharges. While some are located along highways that have rest stops, others are often in shopping center parking lots, a long walk from the stores, or at car dealerships or hotels at which you might not be staying.",
    "If you build it, they will buy",
    "Electric cars don't need fast chargers all the time, of course. The vast majority of the time, electric cars are charged at home or at work, using chargers that can take six to eight hours. Fast chargers are different. They are designed to quickly fill a car's battery -- not all the way, which would stress the battery, but usually up to about 80% -- so people can get back on their way.",
    "Fast chargers are usually only needed when people want to go on long drives. These chargers are important, though, because people considering buying an electric car need to have confidence they can take the occasional road trip.",
    "There are a handful of companies and organizations looking to address that problem. Several have announced partnerships and initiatives to build big networks of EV fast chargers. Some, like EVgo and Tesla, already have fairly extensive networks.",
    "How much customers pay to charge their cars -- and how they pay -- vary. Customers can be charged by the minute, by the kilowatt-hour, or they can pay a flat rate per month. Different companies have \"interoperability\" agreements with one another so someone who has an account with say, Chargepoint, might be able to use chargers operated by Greenlots and vice versa. ",
    "From a business perspective, the chargers by themselves aren't always the point. Parking garages, stores and restaurants often install electric car chargers as a way to attract customers",
    ".",
    " The company that runs the charger will usually charge some sort of fee. For a company like Tesla, chargers are also a major selling point for the company's cars. Tesla executives have frequently said",
    " ",
    "its",
    " ",
    "Supercharger network is not intended as a profit center for the company and the money charged, about 28 cents per kilowatt hour, is just to cover costs. On a recent ",
    "road trip in a Tesla Model S Long Range",
    ", it cost about $20 to charge the car to 80% at a Supercharger. Tesla currently has about 1,600 Supercharger stations globally.",
    "Volkswagen provides the financing behind Electrify America, which is working on one of the largest charging networks in the US. That money is being provided thanks to a settlement VW reached with US regulators over the automaker's diesel ",
    "emissions scandal",
    ". ",
    "VW is also planning one of the largest roll outs of all-electric models in the coming years, but Electrify America is specifically forbidden from using its charger network or marketing to benefit Volkswagen. Electrify America is operated as an entirely separate company and executives insist the company will, on its own, make a profit from people using its charging stations. Electrify America expects to have about 500 fast chargers in the US by the end of the year.",
    "General Motors and the construction company Bechtel are also in the ",
    "early stages of teaming up ",
    "on a proposed charging network. It will be available for use by a variety of electric cars, not just GM's. But it should also help GM in its efforts to sell its electric cars.",
    "\"You're hoping that you place [the chargers] in the right place, and that as the number of vehicles increases, that you're able to get your utilization to a high enough level where you can start making some money off of them,\" said Ben Kellison, a consultant with the firm Wood Mackenzie.",
    "But not everyone is looking for those high traffic routes. ",
    "Duke Energy, an energy provider in the Southeast United States, has begun installing chargers along less-traveled areas, starting with rural areas in northern Florida, where the company will be installing 50 fast charging stations this year. Ultimately, Duke wants to spur broader adoption of electric cars among its home and business electricity customers.",
    "Duke's chargers will be there to give drivers the confidence that they can go anywhere -- not just between big cities. If the chargers are rarely used, that's fine, explained Lang Reynolds, director of electric transportation at Duke Energy. The cars will mostly plug into the power grid at home at night, leading to more efficient use of Duke's electricity generating capacity.",
    "Royal Dutch Shell",
    " has recently acquired two different electric vehicle charging companies, ",
    "the European EV charging company NewMotion",
    " and GreenLots, a US company that provides software for running EV charging networks. Among other things, these acquisitions provide another service Shell gas stations can offer customers even as they switch away from gasoline-powered cars.",
    "And this isn't just happening in the US.",
    " ",
    "In China, BP recently ",
    "announced a partnership",
    " with the ride hailing service Didi to install a network of car charging stations there. BP is already rolling out charging stations in its home market, the United Kingdom. ",
    "Challenges for charging stations",
    "Installing a fast charging station isn't always simple. This is the main reason ",
    "GM teamed up with Bechtel",
    ", a company that has experience working with utilities and local governments on infrastructure projects. For one thing, there are regulatory and permitting issues. Then there's the need to coordinate with local utilities to make sure a charging station can get all the power it needs. And all of this, of course, varies from one state -- and even one city -- to another.  ",
    "The chargers themselves aren't simple, either. While gasoline pump nozzles come in a standard size, there are different types of electric car chargers. For instance, Tesla has its own proprietary charging network and its own chargers, which it calls Superchargers. Tesla cars require a special adapter to charge from other chargers, most of which use either the CCS or CHAdeMO standard, each of which is different from the other. And that also raises the challenges of counting how many chargers there actually are. Is one charger with two different types of charger cords a single charger or is it two chargers? ",
    "There are about 13,000 electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States, according to data from the US Department of Energy. That compares to roughly 332,000 gas stations. There will likely never be as many fast chargers as there are gas stations, said Pat Romano, CEO of ChargePoint, a company that operates software networks for chargers internationally",
    ".",
    " That's because, most electric vehicle charging will be done at home or at work and most electric cars have navigation systems that will guide them to the chargers. Drivers won't be coming across them haphazardly the way they typically find gas stations. That lessens the need to place them anywhere they might conceivably be needed.",
    "There's a lot of experimentation still going on with how best to place fast chargers, whether for maximum use, convenience for the few, or as a way to attract customers for businesses, said Wood Mackenzie's Kellison. And the best way to make money from them is also a question.",
    "\"Anybody who's saying 10 to 15 years from now they know exactly how this is going to run is talking a little too early to have a good idea of how it will shake out,\" he said."

    "Some of the Saudi pages posed as local news websites targeting people in the Middle East and North Africa; other accounts were run using personas made to look like locals from countries in those regions. The network of pages and accounts posted about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's economic and social reform plan, touted what they portrayed as the success of the Saudi armed forces in Yemen, and \"also frequently shared criticism of neighboring countries including Iran, Qatar and Turkey, and called into question the credibility of Al-Jazeera news network and Amnesty International,\" Gleicher wrote.",

    "Facebook said that while it benefited from the information Bellingcat published, it did not find any direct links between the pages it removed and al-Qahtani. ",
    "The kingdom blamed Khashoggi's murder on some of bin Salman's closest aides. Al-Qahtani and several other officials were relieved of their positions in 2018. Saudi prosecutors said al-Qahtani was under investigation and was barred from leaving the kingdom.",

    "Bin Salman has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's death.",
    "In total Facebook took down 217 Facebook accounts, 144 Facebook pages, five Facebook groups, and 31 Instagram accounts that were part of the network.

    "\"We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy. While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally,\" said a spokesperson for Apple.",
    "The spokesperson said that Apple was also working on a software upgrade that would give users the ability to opt out of the program.",

    "In the midst of the escalating trade war between the United States and China, one California rice company is bridging the divide. ",
    "In July 2019, Sun Valley Rice won a contract with a Chinese importer, making it the first US rice producer",
    " ",
    "to sell rice to China. ",
    "\"China has been tough to get into because for many years it was illegal to sell our rice there,\" said Betsy Ward, president of USA Rice, a national trade association.",
    " ",
    "But, in 2018, the ",
    "US and China",
    " came to an agreement, making it legal to export American rice to China. As a result, more than two dozen US companies were approved to export rice to China. But Sun Valley was the first to land a deal. ",
    "Sun Valley, a family-owned company based in Sacramento, California, had been trying to break into the Chinese market for close to 15 years. ",
    "\"We would travel regularly to China to research [the market], attend trade shows and meet the industry players,\" said Ken LaGrande, who founded Sun Valley Rice with his father Michael in 2000. \"It was a commitment we made as a family to persist. So when the opportunity opened up, we were ready.\" ",
    "\"California's rice growing regions are the same latitude as Korea and Japan. So we all grow the same kind of rice -- medium grain and short grain -- that's popular in Chinese, Japanese and Korean cuisine,\" said LaGrande. ",
    "\"But Chinese consumers, who eat rice every day, will now have more choice with our rice,\" he said. \"It is of the highest quality, grown and packaged under strict labor protocols and environmental and safety standards.\" ",
    "Sun Valley annually sells 250 million pounds of rice under half a dozen varieties. Beginning in the fall, the company will export roughly 88,000 pounds",
    " ",
    "of its Calrose rice to Shenzhen Yintuo, a subsidiary of the Dragon Ocean",
    " ",
    "Hing Group, in China. ",
    "Five generations of farmers",
    "The LaGrande family has been producing rice in the Sacramento Valley, starting with LaGrande's great-grandfather in the 1920s.",
    "\"He recognized that the climate, soil and water supply in the region was the correct balance to successfully grow rice,\" said LaGrande.",
    "Over the decades, the family integrated other aspects of rice production into the business, such as drying and milling. Eventually, it grew to become LaGrande Family Foods Group. \"Now it's a couple of dozen different operations,\" he said. Those include farming, sprouting rice and sake milling.",
    "In 2000, LaGrande and his father Michael identified a growing market demand for high quality, specialized sushi-grade rice, and launched Sun Valley Rice.",
    " ",
    "\"Sun Valley Rice now is a fully integrated arm of the family business, 'from farm to fork' if you will,\" said LaGrande. \"We source rice from 200 farms, or about 10% of the rice crop gown in California. And we handle drying, milling, packaging and marketing of the rice.\" ",
    "LaGrande is mindful of the business risks involved with entering new markets.",
    " ",
    "\"Anytime we export to a foreign country, there are risks we think about,\" he said. \"But we also develop strategies to help is mitigate those risks.\"",
    "Sun Valley exports its rice to the European Union, for example, where the ",
    "ongoing trade negotiations ",
    "with the US has resulted in extra tariffs on rice, said LaGrande. ",
    "And entering a new market can surface additional layers of protocol and red tape. \"We have to deal with inspectors. What if our cargo gets tied up at customs as part of the inspection process? We have to be prepared for it,\" he said.",
    "The US rice industry has also experienced trade disruptions due to measures designed to protect humans, animals and plants from diseases or contamination. ",
    "\"These were not necessarily based on sound science, but more political,\" said USA Rice's Ward.",
    " ",
    "\"Although we are happy that this sale was made, and we expect it to be successful, there is always a risk that future sales could be disrupted. It is the name of the game in the rice trade.\"",
    "Still, LaGrande is hopeful that Sun Valley Rice's entry into China opens the gate for other American rice brands.",
    "\"We have the first sale. But we really hope there will be strong continuing demand for American rice in China, and that allows, in turn, more opportunity for farmers back in California,\" he said. "

    "Hong Kong (CNN Business)",
    "The ",
    "US-China trade truce is over",
    ", and that's bad news for Huawei. ",
    "US President Donald Trump's plan to slap new tariffs on Chinese goods could threaten a promised reprieve for the Chinese tech company, which ",
    "has become a flashpoint",
    " in the escalating trade war. ",
    "Before Trump fired his latest salvo, there had been some expectation that he could ease restrictions on the company. Huawei, which is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and a leading smartphone brand, has been on a US trade blacklist since May.",
    "But the decision to reignite the trade war with a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods from September 1 — effectively a tax on all goods from China that come into the United States — throws any respite into question.",
    "\"[T]his escalation increases the risk that Trump reneges on his pledges to save Huawei,\" analysts at the Eurasia Group wrote in a note Friday morning. ",
    "Washington's trade blacklist bars American firms from selling tech and software to Huawei unless they get a license to do so. The United States says the company is a national security concern, and claims it engages in activities that run counter to US foreign policy interests. Huawei denies that is the case, and says that none of its products pose a national security risk. ",
    "Trump ",
    "said in June",
    " that he would relax some of those restrictions — a concession to Beijing, and potentially relief for some of Huawei's suppliers, such as ",
    "Google",
    " ",

    ")",
    ". US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday that the government could begin responding next week to requests for licenses to resume sales to Huawei, ",
    "according to a Reuters report",
    ".",
    "While Trump didn't mention Huawei in any of his latest trade tweets, his tariff announcement could complicate that plan. His broadside followed an uneventful round of talks in Shanghai, where the president heard there were no concrete promises from China to purchase American agricultural products.",
    "\"Unless China restarts agricultural purchases soon, he will have little to show for a move that is deeply unpopular with China hawks,\" the Eurasia Group analysts wrote, in reference to the proposed relief for Huawei. \"And if Trump backs away from promises to issue licenses to Huawei's US suppliers, the odds of negotiations breaking down and tariffs being imposed rises.\"",
    "Huawei declined to comment on Friday. ",
    "The company has acknowledged that the ban is hurting its business. ",
    "Overseas smartphone sales plunged 40%",
    " after the trade ban, founder Ren Zhengfei said in May.",
    "And during an earnings presentation Tuesday, Huawei Chairman Liang Hua",
    " ",
    "said the company will continue to \"face difficulties\" in the second half of this year and next year. ",
    "Still, Huawei touted its growth. Liang said its 5G business — in which the company is a global leader — is strong. Analysts, however, have said ",
    "the US campaign against Huawei could slow its global rollout of 5G",
    ".",
    "Liang",
    " ",
    "added that Huawei has recovered some of the overseas sales it lost after the US ban went into effect. But if Trump doesn't relax restrictions on the Chinese firm, that could rekindle consumers' concerns over buying Huawei smartphones and create uncertainties for ",
    "mobile operators",
    " that sell the devices. The ban has prevented companies like Google from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of the Android operating system and popular apps like Gmail and Google Maps.",
    "The Huawei ban threatens American businesses, too. Chipmakers have asked the Trump administration to allow sales to Huawei to resume. ",
    "Earlier this week, Qualcomm and ",
    "AMD",
    " ",
    "(",
    "AMD",

    "The company employs women to sell products like lamps, stoves, and even TVs that run on solar power through a program called Solar Sahelis (Solar Friends). Each woman is in charge of selling products to hundreds of rural households.",
    "\"We learned that while the customer — the person paying for the product — was a man, the person using the product was a woman,\" Frontier Markets CEO Ajaita Shah said in an interview with CNN Business. \"In fact, 70% of our users were women and that is when we realized that in order to properly serve the right households needs, women had to be at the center of that value chain,\" she added. ",
    "Shah founded Frontier Markets in 2011, with the goal of providing clean energy to millions of rural Indians while also giving women a source of employment and income. The goals encapsulate some of India's most urgent issues. ",
    "The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made rural electrification a big priority, ",
    "announcing last year",
    " that 100% of the country's villages now have access to power. But the government considers a village electrified if just 10% of its houses are on the grid, meaning over 200 million people still don't have access to electricity. ",
    "The Modi government has also set aggressive targets to ",

    "The 3,000 women that Shah employs have helped to provide energy to more than half a million village houses in Rajasthan, she said. The women communicate the benefits of clean energy to rural households, but also help Frontier Markets understand the kind of innovations that those households need most, she added.",
    "Another pressing need that Frontier Markets is helping to solve is getting more women into work. Only ",

    "\"As India starts growing and moving and changing and evolving, especially with the digital revolution, women are still being left behind,\" Shah said. \"It's really important for us to continuously invest in our women's skills and their education to be able to catch up.\"",
    "The business model appears to be working. Frontier Markets' annual revenue has gone from around $300,000 in 2015 to nearly $2.7 million this year, and the company has partnered with big global names like Philips and ",

    "Audrey Hepburn",
    " and ",
    "Scarlett Johansson",
    ". ",
    "The reason for these shades of technological white may be racism, according to new research.",
    "\"Robots And Racism,\" ",
    "a study conducted by the Human Interface Technology Laboratory in New Zealand (HIT Lab NZ) and published by the country's University of Canterbury, suggests people perceive physically human-like robots",
    " ",
    "to have a race and therefore apply racial stereotypes to white and black robots. ",
    "These colors have been found to trigger social cues that determine how humans react to and behave toward other people and also, apparently, robots. ",
    "\"The bias against black robots is a result of bias against African-Americans,\" lead researcher Christoph Bartneck explained to ",
    "The Next Web",
    ". He told CNN, \"It is amazing to see how people who had no prior interaction with robots show racial bias towards them.\"",
    "The researchers think this is an issue that needs to be addressed. \"If robots are supposed to function as teachers, friends, or carers, for instance, then it will be a serious problem if all of these roles are only ever occupied by robots that are racialized as White,\"",
    " ",
    "according to the study. ",
    "The robots used in the study are clearly robots but have human-like limbs and a head, with exterior complexions that are white -- which is to say, pinkish -- or black -- really, a deep brown. In the \"shooter bias\" test, black and white people and robots appeared on a screen for less than a second, and participants were told to \"shoot\" those holding a weapon.",
    " ",
    "Black robots that were not holding weapons were shot more than the white ones not carrying guns. ",
    "Run a simple Google Image search on the term \"robot.\" You won't see a lot of color, as pointed out in the study.",
    " ",
    "The researchers see this overrepresentation of white robots as potentially harmful to the perception of other races. ",
    "Robot designers come from all corners of the world, Bartneck pointed out, yet they still idealize white robots. ",
    "\"Human-shaped robots should represent the diversity of humans,\" Bartneck told The Next Web. ",
    "\"Imagine a world in which all Barbie dolls are white. Imagine a world in which all the robots working in Africa or India are white. Further imagine that these robots take over roles that involve authority. Clearly, this would raise concerns about imperialism and white supremacy,\" Bartneck told CNN. \"Robots are not just machines, but they represent humans.\"",
    "In a second study, the HIT Lab NZ team added lighter brown robots, finding that as they increased the racial diversity, participants' racial bias toward the robots disappeared altogether. This \"potentially means that diversification of robots might lead to a reduction in racial bias towards them,\" ",
    "according to that study",
    ".",
    "\"This leads me to believe that we have everything to win by offering racial options and nothing to lose,\" Bartneck told CNN. ",
    "\"In the same way that we do want Barbie dolls in all colors and shapes, we also want robots in more than just white.\""

    " it was working on a project for typing words onto a computer right from your brain, without requiring invasive surgery to make it work.",
    "The company has been working with several universities on the effort, including the University of California, San Francisco. Facebook helped pay for UCSF researchers to study whether electrodes placed in the brain could help us learn to \"decode\" speech from brainwaves in real time.",
    "As it turns out, this is possible: A study ",
    "published Tuesday",
    " showed that researchers could instantly see — as text on a computer screen — a word or phrase that a participant was saying by looking at brain activity, as long as it was among a limited set of answers in response to predetermined questions. The study includes three epilepsy patients voluntarily implanted with electrodes.",
    "Facebook is also footing the bill for a new, year-long study that UCSF is currently conducting where it will try to use brain activity to help a person who can't speak communicate. The social network hopes the efforts could help reveal which brain signals are key for that non-invasive wearable that it's planning",
    " ",
    "for in the years ahead. ",
    "\"We expect that to take upwards of 10 years,\" Mark Chevillet, a research director at Facebook Reality Labs who runs its brain-computer interface group, told CNN Business of the overall project. \"This is a long-term research program.\"",
    "An idea years in the making ",
    "At Facebook's 2017 developer conference, F8, the company painted a fantastical picture of a mysterious, noninvasive device that would pick up on your brain signals and one day enable you to type 100 words per minute. ",
    "Such a gadget would be a far cry from the brain-computer interfaces scientists have been working on for decades.",
    " ",
    "They still tend to be stuck in labs because they are pricey, have to be implanted under a user's skull, and need to be connected to a computer to perform even the simplest tasks. ",
    "Not much has been heard about Facebook's research since. Six months after showing it off on stage, Regina Dugan, the leader of Facebook's secretive hardware division, Building 8, left the company (Building 8's research efforts have since been added to Facebook Reality Labs, a which includes a ",
    "range",
    " of virtual- and augmented-reality research). More recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ",
    "mentioned it",
    " during a talk at Harvard in March, saying he's excited about \"reshaping our computing platforms to be fundamentally more about people and how we process the world.\"",
    "Now, however, some of Facebook's efforts are coming to light with",
    " ",
    "news of the ongoing research projects. ",
    "Electrodes on their brains",
    "Participants in UCSF's study are people with epilepsy who had a small patch of electrodes implanted on their brains in hopes of figuring out where their epileptic seizures originated; they volunteered to help with the Facebook-related study while in the hospital.",
    "For the work related to Facebook, researchers had participants listen to questions while tracking their brain activity. Machine-learning algorithms eventually determined how to spot when participants were answering a question and which one of 24 answers they were",
    " ",
    "choosing.",
    "Translating what happens inside your brain into words is hard and doing it immediately is even harder. The speech decoding algorithms the researchers used were accurate up to 61% of the time at figuring out which of two dozen standard responses a participant spoke, right after the person was done talking. ",
    "This may not sound all that impressive, but",
    " ",
    "Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon and professor of neurosurgery at UCSF who coauthored the study released this week believes it's a \"really important result\" that could help people who have lost the ability to speak.",
    "Facebook's",
    " ",
    "Chevillet, who previously worked at Johns Hopkins University as an adjunct professor of neuroscience, said the UCSF work is an \"important yet somewhat expected milestone,\" as the interpretation of brain signals tends to be done offline rather than in real time. Facebook, he said, has no interest in making any sort of medical device; what it wants is to understand the neural signals needed to create a silent speech interface. ",
    "A year-long study",
    "Chang called the work in the paper published this week a \"proof of concept.\" Another Facebook-sponsored brain-computer-interface project he recently began in his lab is much lengthier: Chang will spend a year working with a single patient (a male who can no longer speak), tracking his brain activity with the same kind of electrode array used on the epilepsy patients, in hopes of restoring some of his communication abilities.",
    "\"We've got a tall order ahead of us to figure out how to make that work,\" Chang said.",
    "If it does, it could one day help a range of people, from those who have lost the ability to speak due to various brain-related injuries, to people who simply want to control a computer or send a message with their mind.",
    "Meanwhile, at Facebook...",
    "Chevillet said his group at Facebok is continuing its work on finding noninvasive ways to figure out what's happening within the brain, too. It's investigating how light may be able to indirectly track brain activity, specifically by using near-infrared light to measure oxygen saturation levels in your brain.",
    "Though any sort of think-to-type device you might be able to buy is still far in the future, Chevillet can already imagine how he thinks it should look: a pair of glasses that uses augmented reality and",
    " ",
    "includes a brain-based method for doing everything from sending a text message to adjusting the volume of a song to simply performing the equivalent of a mouse click.",
    "\"The use cases we envision are certainly for everybody,\" he said.",

    "Kidney issues are well known to make ",
    "already sick patients even sicker",
    ". The researchers built and tested software that can predict acute kidney injury with the help of a dataset made up of electronic health records from over 700,000 adult patients. The software was able to look at anonymized health records of hospital patients and predict nearly 56% of all serious kidney problems they would encounter, and about 90% of kidney issues so serious that they required dialysis. The problems could be detected as far as 48 hours in advance of them taking place.",
    "\"Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, doctors and nurses may start getting a warning a day or two before for these acute causes of patient deterioration,\" Dr. Dominic King, DeepMind's health lead and coauthor of the research paper, told CNN Business.",
    "The work is still in the early stages, and there are some caveats that accompany the results: The researchers noted their system gave two false alerts for every true alert of a kidney injury. And nearly all the patients in the dataset the researchers used (about 94%) were male, so it's not yet known if the work would be similarly helpful for spotting kidney failure in women.",
    "But it advances what's known about how deep learning — a form of AI modeled after the way neurons work in the brain, which ingests loads of data and learns to make its own predictions — may be helpful in healthcare.",
    "While deep learning is already known to be useful for ",
    "identifying health issues",
    " such as skin rashes or cancers in scans, slides, and photos, it's not as advanced when it comes to predicting health problems. ",
    "Kidney issues in particular are tricky to identify in advance. These days, doctors and nurses are alerted to acute kidney injury via a patient's blood test, King said, but by the time that information comes through, the organ may already be damaged.",
    "The research isn't yet ready for clinical practice but it's impressive, said Eric Topol, a professor at Scripps Research and author of \"Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again.\" He believes it could eventually be helpful in part because doctors are simply bad at making predictions about what will happen to individual patients. ",
    "\"We think someone's going to die and then they're like Lazarus, or we think they're going to not be readmitted and they come back in an hour. We're just not good at this,\" he said. \"Applying deep learning for this common and serious issue, kidney injury — that's really smart.\"",
    "Eventually, King envisions alerts about potential kidney problems coming straight to doctors and nurses via a smartphone app. And, in fact, a DeepMind healthcare app called ",
    "Streams",
    " is being used in National Health Service hospitals in the UK; it can alert clinicians if results of a standard blood-test indicate a problem with a patient's kidneys. Adding an AI-based prediction to this, King said, would let doctors and nurses know far sooner about a potentially serious health issue.",
    "Before rolling an AI system out with any patients, though, King said the researchers would need to make sure their model works accurately with patients of different genders and backgrounds."

They said they were able to animate one or several photos of people by first training an AI system on a dataset of videos including many celebrities, so it could learn about key points on the face.

    "uses the same AI technique behind deepfakes, which is a machine-learning method known as GANs, or generative adversarial networks.

    "A manipulated video",

    "The researchers' work is still in the early stages: The AI system was only trained to create a person's head, neck and some of the shoulders. And while a ",
    "clip",
    " created with a single reference photo of a woman looked plausible (though somewhat low-resolution), other clips that were made with eight and 32 images of her looked increasingly realistic.",
    "Siwei Lyu, who studies deepfakes and is director of the computer vision and machine learning lab at University at Albany, SUNY, told CNN Business that the research could make it easier to create deepfakes with less data than they currently require. These days, that tends to be more than 30 seconds worth of video of both of the person you want to manipulate and another person who must also be filmed doing the desired motions.",

    "Indeed, the Industrial Revolution began with the construction of the first factories and ended with the publication of the Communist Manifesto. Revolutionary technologies lead to political strife.",
    "Why did working people agree to participate in the industrialization process if it reduced their utility? The simple answer is that they didn't. They petitioned to parliament to bring the installation of machines to a halt. And they rioted against the mechanized factory. While much popular commentary has focused on the Luddite uprisings of 1811-1816, they were only part of a long wave of machinery riots that swept across Britain, France, Germany and China, among other places. ",
    "Just like early spinning machines took the jobs of middle-income craftsmen, industrial robots have more recently diminished opportunities for the American middle class. The wages for men with no more than a high-school diploma, who would have flocked into factories before the rise of the robots, have steadily fallen since the 1980s. And, MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo find that each industrial robot replaced about 3.3 jobs in the U.S. economy.",
    "Jobs haven't disappeared evenly across the American economy. There are ",
    "more robots",
    " in Michigan alone today than in the entire American west. Where the robots are is also where American's and their communities are hurting. Where jobs and incomes have disappeared, the opioid crisis is more prevalent, ",
    "crime",
    " and ",
    "suicide",
    " is on the rise, ",
    "marriage rates",
    " are faltering, and unsurprisingly, people are more prone to vote for populist candidates. ",
    "My ",
    "research",
    " with Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen of the Oxford Martin School shows that Donald Trump made the largest gains, relative to Mitt Romney's election result, in communities where robots were adopted most extensively. As during the Industrial Revolution, the losers to technology are demanding change.",
    "Many automation technologies loom on the horizon. Nearly 3.5 million Americans work as cashiers, but if you shop at an ",
    "AmazonGo",
    " store you won't see cashiers or checkout lanes. And autonomous cars could replace the jobs of millions of truck, bus and taxi drivers. ",
    "And we haven't seen anything yet. As artificial intelligence becomes more pervasive, so will automation and its effects. My research with Michael Osborne found that 47% of U.S. jobs could be automated due to recent advances in AI.",
    "If history is any guidance, we could also see a similar backlash against automation. Hiking up tariffs is not going to bring manufacturing jobs back, which are already being automated away, even in China. What's more, the rise of China has already happened and most people in America today work in services that are delivered locally. In other words, most Americans are shielded from future globalization. But they aren't shielded from AmazonGo or autonomous cars. ",
    "The Luddite impulse may well return. And if the introduction of new technologies are blocked because some fear losing their jobs, long-term growth and economic prosperity will suffer as a consequence. The main difference between our current technological revolution and the Industrial Revolution is that the Luddites didn't have political rights. Today, in contrast, people don't have to vote with sticks and stones; they can simply show up on Election Day.",
    "The long-term economic benefits of the Industrial Revolution were undisputable. But the industrialization process itself was a different matter. In similar fashion, the potential long-term benefits of AI are enormous. But harnessing them will require governments to implement policies to smooth the short-term disruptive consequences and avoid backlash."

    "A ",
    "UK national travel survey",
    " found that adults with mobility difficulties took 39% fewer trips than those with no disability in 2017. Yet that could change as devices and cities grow smarter. ",

    " ",
    "Zion Market Research",
    " and ",
    "Coherent Market Insights",
    ".",
    "Here are three high-tech solutions making cities easier for people with disabilities.",
    "A wheelchair that can climb stairs",
    "Jose Di Felice, from Switzerland, was paralyzed in both legs and one arm after a high-speed motorcycle accident three years ago.  ",
    "While adjusting to life in a wheelchair, he realized that stairs were his biggest hurdle. He took to YouTube to look for alternatives and discovered ",
    "Scewo",
    ". The startup has built a wheelchair that can be controlled through a smartphone. It can tackle a range of terrains, and has special rubber tracks for climbing stairs.",
    "Di Felice requested a test drive and soon after he was",
    " ",
    "climbing the steps of the local town hall in a wheelchair. \"It was really emotional to go up these stairs, and look down there and say that it's possible,\" he says.",
    "The wheelchair is expected to be distributed to users by the end of 2019, and Di Felice will be one of the first to receive the product.",
    "\"We cannot wait on having all these ramps built,\" Bernhard Winter, the CEO and founder of Scewo, says of urban mobility. \"This is why we developed this product, so it gives you back mobility and freedom.\"",
    "A robotic exomuscle suit",
    "Wearable tech is also becoming more sophisticated. Zurich-based start-up ",
    "MyoSwiss",
    " has developed an exomuscle suit with a combination of robotics and textiles.",
    "The robotic garment, weighing less than 5 kilograms (11 pounds), adds a layer of muscle that supports movements and provides stability to people with mobility impairments. It uses sensors at the knee and hip to detect movements the user wants to make and helps accordingly.",
    "\"It assists people that need extra force or extra assistance in their daily life,\" says Jaime Duarte, CEO of MyoSwiss. \"[It's] for people that can still walk to some extent but maybe struggle to stand out from a chair or struggle to go upstairs.\"",
    "This year the MyoSuit enabled two people with mobility limitations to take part in a relay version of the Zurich marathon. ",
    "Smart walking stick ",
    "Another technology that could transform lives is a smart walking stick designed by engineers from Young Guru Academy (YGA) in Turkey. ",
    "The ",
    "WeWalk",
    " stick has an ultrasonic sensor that detects obstacles above chest level and uses vibrations to warn the user. It can be paired with a smartphone to help navigation, and is integrated with a voice assistant and Google Maps.",
    "According to the ",
    "World Health Organization",
    ", 39 million people worldwide are blind and another quarter of a billion are visually impaired. ",
    "\"In these days we are talking about flying cars,\" says Kursat Ceylan, CEO and founder of WeWalk, \"but these people have been using just a plain stick.\"",
    "Ceylan, who has been blind since birth, says that connecting the stick to the Internet of Things and smart city solutions makes it user-friendly. ",
    "\"As a blind person, when I am at the Metro station I don't know which is my exit ... I don't know which bus is approaching ... [or] which stores are around me. That kind of information can be provided with the WeWalk,\" he says.",
    "But will these high-tech solutions be accessible?",
    "\"These are all really exciting initiatives that will make a huge difference to some people,\" says Anna Lawson, the director of the Center for Disability Studies at Leeds University in the United Kingdom. ",
    "\"But they are very expensive ... they're not going to be available to the vast majority of disabled people,\" she added.",
    "Bryan Matthews, a lecturer at the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds, shares the concerns about cost. He says there should also be a focus on inclusive design. ",
    "But anything that helps people navigate their environment is positive. ",
    "\"By making disabled people more visible and more mainstream then you foster more potential for understanding and empathy,\" says Matthews."

    "Global oil demand is likely to keep rising",
    " ",
    "for at least another 15 years before Asia's fast growing economies catch up to the shift from hydrocarbons to ",
    "electric power",
    ", a leading consultancy said on Monday. ",
    "\"At some point in the next 20 years, it's likely we're going to see oil demand peak. Our own view at Wood Mackenzie, is around 2035, 2036,\" Wood Mackenzie chairman Simon Flowers said in an interview with CNN Business. ",
    "The International Energy Agency, which monitors energy supply for the world's richest countries, said earlier this year that there was \"no peak demand on the horizon.\" ",
    "A ",
    "potential peak in oil",
    " demand is one of the central questions hanging over the energy industry. The timing could impact trillions of dollars of investment decisions and play a major role in the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Flowers said that there is already very little demand growth in the European Union, and \"in time\" demand in America will also drop off.  ",
    "Almost all of the demand growth for oil is now concentrated in Asia. China, India, Japan, South Korea and Singapore are the top five oil importers in the region, according to Wood Mackenzie.",
    " ",
    "Total demand for oil across those countries grew by 2.5% in 2018 to 25.9 million barrels per day, with China and India accounting for the vast majority of the growth. ",
    "\"Eventually that too will give in as electric vehicles become competitive and start to take market share from the internal combustion engine,\" Flowers said. ",
    "Once that shift to electric cars happens, China should",
    " ",
    "be in a strong position to benefit. ",
    "The country",
    " ",
    "has the world's biggest auto market, it has manufacturing capability and \"it has access to some of the key battery raw materials, like lithium, that we need for electric vehicles,\" said Flowers. ",
    "China has invested heavily in the electric vehicle industry. ",
    "The government offered generous subsidies to electric and hybrid car buyers for years. ",
    "Beijing is now weaning customers off those subsidies, and shifting some of the burden of growing the electric car market to manufacturers. This year, ",
    "new rules",
    " kicked in mandating that at least 10% of car companies' sales be all-electric battery vehicles or plug-in hybrids. The rules apply to car manufacturers that produce or import more than 30,000 vehicles annually, and would rise to 12% in 2020. "
