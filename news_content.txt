The original article can be seen here\\n\\nNothing reflects the lasting potency of the iconic \"Tank Man\" photo quite like the dogged attempts to censor it on China\\'s internet. Practically any image that so much as gestures at the famed photograph of a man in front of a line of tanks in Tiananmen Square risks deletion from the country\\'s closely monitored web; recreations showing a line of books approaching a cigarette package, a swan before an oncoming truck and a grasshopper in front of a tire have all been removed.\\n\\nJeff Widener\\'s iconic photo remains widely censored in China.\\n\\nAccording to Weiboscope -- a social media monitoring project at Hong Kong University -- even Francisco Goya\\'s \"Third of May 1808\" (1814), which echoes the Tank Man in sentiment and composition, could not make it past censors.\\n\\nBehind China\\'s Great Firewall -- which is more like a continually shifting, dynamic barrier -- the Tiananmen Square massacre did not happen, the ongoing Hong Kong extradition bill protests are incited by Western countries and Winnie the Pooh doesn\\'t exist . This tightly controlled media climate has given rise to innovative circumvention tactics. While searchable keywords in plain text face automated deletion, digital images require more nuanced monitoring.\\n\\nNews articles from banned websites like the New York Times appear in upside-down screenshots on Weibo, a social site akin to Twitter (which is blocked in China). One writer managed to keep a photo from the Hong Kong protests up on WeChat, but only after adding brushstrokes and flipping it sideways. Resourceful netizens also use images of ordinary objects and cartoon characters as symbols in an ever-growing visual lexicon made for dodging censorship.\\n\\nIn recent months, the grip on the internet has tightened. In June, the protests and the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre kept censors on edge. The Washington Post and The Guardian were freshly banned, along with a handful of other major news sites. And a series of sensitive anniversaries in July -- including deadly riots in Xinjiang in 2009 and the death of democracy advocate Liu Xiaobo in 2017 -- pose more challenges for Chinese internet censors trying to clean the web of what government leaders call \"spiritual pollution.\"\\n\\nJason Ng, author of \"Blocked on Weibo\" (2013), notes that the Chinese government\\'s utmost priority is discouraging unified, anti-establishment action. But for Ng, the intrigue lies in the gray areas -- where the state does more than prevent political unrest. \"Clearly, it is not only protests that are being censored. There is some sort of intentionality,\" he said. \"It is fascinating to think through the moral reasons why things are removed. How does the government try to shape social mores? How do they try to shape culture through censorship?\"\\n\\nSome removed images are unsurprising: depictions of state-sanctioned violence, cartoons disparaging government leaders and aerial shots of protests. But many of them appear innocuous at first glance. All images -- even harmless ones -- of top Chinese political leaders are banned, except on official websites and approved blogs.\\n\\nFor other content, moderators tend to err on the side of caution since private companies, rather than the government, are responsible for complying with state guidelines. After President Xi Jinping eliminated term limits, for example, censors temporarily banned the letter \"n,\" which was likely a reference to the math symbol and was used to poke fun at the undefined length of his tenure.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party is particularly sensitive to politically charged jokes. In 2013, when an image comparing then-US president Barack Obama and Xi Jinping to Tigger and Pooh Bear went viral, the rotund honey aficionado was quickly banned, and last year, the movie Christopher Robin did not release in China.\\n\\nWinnie the Pooh and Tigger, on the left, have been compared to Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US leader Barack Obama. Credit: Fandom/Getty Images\\n\\nCharlie Smith, a pseudonym for the co-founder of GreatFire.org, a China-based information freedom organization, believes this is a testament to the sensitivity of China\\'s leader.\\n\\n\"Quite honestly, if you were to be compared to any kind of cartoon character, you could do way worse than Winnie the Pooh -- maybe Squidward,\" he mused.\\n\\nWhile Pooh Bear might be the best-known of the playful creatures removed from China\\'s web, he\\'s not the only one. Years earlier, censors blotted out mention of a 72-foot-tall inflatable frog after internet users likened it to former president Jiang Zemin, once nicknamed \"toad.\" And after a 2013 recreation of \"Tank Man\" replaced the tanks with inflatable rubber ducks, \"the yellow rubber duck, in whatever context, was doomed to the blacklist forever,\" Smith said.\\n\\nAnything that might jog netizens\\' memory of controversial events is subject to scrutiny. Images of candles, typically held at memorials, are removed around the time of the Tiananmen Square anniversary. Other, more covert references, such as playing cards that read \"8964\" for the year 1989 and date June 4, have been removed.\\n\\nWhen Liu Xiaobo died in July 2017, censors went so far as to block out images of an empty chair -- Liu was honored with an empty chair at the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony when he was barred from leaving the country, turning a mundane household object into a political symbol.\\n\\nBeating censorship means making the image obscure to censors but clear to fellow internet users. Homonyms help: Because Chinese is a tonal language, words have different meanings based on how they are pronounced, leaving room for a myriad of wordplay.\\n\\nCapturing China\\'s changing society on canvas\\n\\nOne of the earlier viral uses of a homonym can be traced back to the creation of the mythical \"grass mud horse.\" The Chinese phrase \"cao ni ma,\" enunciated one way, can mean \"grass mud horse,\" but pronounced another way, it means \"f*** your mother.\" The two pronunciations have different Chinese characters, allowing the mythical creature to remain uncensored despite obscenity policies.\\n\\nThe subversive horse was featured in an Ai Weiwei photo, starred in a music video and eventually grew into an internet legend about its battle with the hexie, or \"river crab.\" In Chinese, hexie also sounds like \"harmony,\" referencing former president Hu Jintao\\'s initiative to create a \"harmonious society.\" Ai has incorporated this symbol into his work as well -- his 2010 work \"He Xie\" (crabs) features 3,200 porcelain crabs, and when the government condemned Ai\\'s Shanghai studio, he invited supporters over to eat crab before the demolition.\\n\\n\"He Xie\" (2010) by Ai Weiwei Credit: Brooklyn Museum\\n\\nBut censors catch up with even the most ingenious of homophones. On May 21, two weeks before the anniversary of Tiananmen Square, a photo of baijiu -- a type of alcohol that also sounds like the numbers eight (ba) and nine (jiu) -- alluded to 1989, and is believed to have resulted in filmmaker Deng Chuanbin\\'s detainment. When #metoo (wo yeshi) was censored out of concern it would spread Western sentiments, Chinese netizens started posting \"mi tu,\" or \"rice bunny,\" which sounds like \"MeToo.\" Soon, \"mi tu\" was also banned, and images of rice bunnies popped up in its place.\\n\\nChina\\'s approach to internet censorship parallels its economic model more broadly: offer enough freedom for people not to feel constrained, but not so much as to organize and challenge the existing structure. It\\'s a fine line and a blurry one, and like a recent viral Weibo post pointed out, the absence of major international news on the Chinese internet is becoming \"increasingly strange.\" (Shortly after, the post was deleted.)\\n\\nBut Smith believes there is at least some cause for reserved optimism. \"Given the rise of image-based social networks and improved smartphone technology, it\\'s also becoming easier to doctor an image if one wants to try to evade censorship,\" he wrote in an email. \"Maybe Winnie the Pooh will come back in another form!\"', 'summary': 'And a series of sensitive anniversaries in July -- including deadly riots in Xinjiang in 2009 and the death of democracy advocate Liu Xiaobo in 2017 -- pose more challenges for Chinese internet censors trying to clean the web of what government leaders call \"spiritual pollution.\"\\nAll images -- even harmless ones -- of top Chinese political leaders are banned, except on official websites and approved blogs.\\nWinnie the Pooh and Tigger, on the left, have been compared to Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US leader Barack Obama.\\nImages of candles, typically held at memorials, are removed around the time of the Tiananmen Square anniversary.\\nIt\\'s a fine line and a blurry one, and like a recent viral Weibo post pointed out, the absence of major international news on the Chinese internet is becoming \"increasingly strange.\"', 'keywords': ['protests', 'internet', 'pooh', 'censors', 'president', 'images', 'tiananmen', 'forbidden', 'square', 'chinese', 'banned']}"

John F. Kennedy was set to become the first US leader born in the 20th century, the first Catholic commander-in-chief and the first president whose inaugural speech was beamed across crackly television screens in color\\n\\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,\" he implored a nation in need of reassurance and leadership at the height of the Cold War.\\n\\nPresident Kennedy with First Lady Jackie at his inauguration. Credit: Leonard McCombe/The LIFE Picture Collection/The LIFE Picture Collection via\\n\\nNot everything worked out as planned. Eight inches of snow fell on Washington DC overnight, winds lashed and, among all this, one accident would end up infiltrating American wardrobes.\\n\\nJackie\\'s orb-like hat had been made to match a coat and fawn dress already created for her by her personal courtier Oleg Cassini. But it was also designed to look different: A cloth pillbox was exactly what everyone else would not be wearing.\\n\\nIn the freezing cold, the many of the women sported stolid mink caps -- except Jackie, who stood out as the beacon of a new generation, characterized by clean lines and elegance. She appeared on the steps of the Capitol like \"the gorgeous petal in a dowdy bouquet of fur,\" according to Thurston Clarke, author of \"Ask Not,\" a book about the 1961 inauguration.\\n\\nJackie\\'s distinctive headpiece was designed by Halston (real name Roy Halston Frowick). Later known as the creator of the free-flowing, slinky fashion of the 1970s disco era, Halston was then an up-and-coming New York milliner. He apparently spent hours sandwiched between two mirrors, shaping Jackie\\'s hat into a perfect, simple dome.\\n\\nExcept, of course, it didn\\'t end up like that.\\n\\nMeet America\\'s first superstar fashion designer\\n\\nThat morning, as she reached up to clasp the hat in high winds, Kennedy accidentally gave it a dimple -- a shallow indent, unnoticed but broadcast around the world. America swooned nonetheless. Kennedy\\'s deification as the ultimate first lady of fashion had begun with a misshapen hat, its influence stretching to imitators from high society to the rural Midwest. Halston later laughed that \"everybody who copied it put a dent in it.\"\\n\\nJackie\\'s ensemble that day -- which she completed with a sable circlet and muff -- has become one of the most celebrated of presidential inauguration looks. But there\\'s one thing we may have all been getting wrong: the color.\\n\\nWhile most Americans will remember the first lady in duck-egg blue , complementing JFK\\'s steel blue waistcoat and tie, color film footage from \"Halston,\" a new CNN Films documentary about the legendary designer, shows her inauguration outfit appearing pinkish. And researchers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, where the outfit is stored, told CNN that the dress and hat were basically colorless -- a neutral, fawnish beige and not even slightly blue.\\n\\nThe origin of the mistake seems to be a color photograph from Life Magazine . But the cover of the same issue featured a very different photograph: Jackie in far less vivid tones, closer to the off-white captured by the handful of other press photographers present (early color film often struggled to match real hues).\\n\\nSo when, in 2017, Melania Trump wore a powder blue Ralph Lauren inauguration suit likened to Kennedy\\'s, was it a tribute to an outfit that never existed?\\n\\nwas Melania Trump paying tribute to a dress that wasn\\'t really blue? Credit: Pool/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\\n\\nRegardless of color, dimpled or not, the pillbox hat would become synonymous with Jackie\\'s style as first lady. She wore one the day JFK was shot, twinned with a raspberry pink suit. The blood-covered suit is locked away in the National Archives, with instructions that it should hidden from public view until at least 2103 . The pink hat hasn\\'t been seen since the fateful day she last wore it.\\n\\nBut the eulogizing of the first lady\\'s \"looks\" risks relegating her to the role of a mere mannequin, when she in fact directed much of the new administration\\'s aesthetic -- and not just when it came to fashion.\\n\\nShe may have spent fewer than three years in the White House, but during that time she brought in designers, including Stéphane Boudin, to modernize its interior. She also worked with legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy, the man behind the Lucky Strike cigarette packet and classic Studebaker cars, to choose the enduring powder blue of the US presidential plane, Air Force One.\\n\\nJFK\\'s inauguration marked the beginning of a new era of media-savvy presidents -- and he had his wife to thank for much of it.', 'summary': \"Remember when Jackie Kennedy attended her husband's presidential inauguration with a perfect egg-shaped pillbox hat perched atop her head?\\nPresident Kennedy with First Lady Jackie at his inauguration.\\nBut it was also designed to look different: A cloth pillbox was exactly what everyone else would not be wearing.\\nJackie's ensemble that day -- which she completed with a sable circlet and muff -- has become one of the most celebrated of presidential inauguration looks.\\nCredit: Pool/Getty Images North America/Getty ImagesRegardless of color, dimpled or not, the pillbox hat would become synonymous with Jackie's style as first lady.\", 'keywords': ['kennedy', 'presidential', 'jackie', 'color', 'halston', 'wore', '1961', 'pillbox', 'blue', 'lady', 'hat', 'inauguration', 'kennedys']}"

Among the hot favorites to be relegated, many predict the newly-promoted team to provide little opposition to Jurgen Klopp\\'s Liverpool , still riding the wave of its UEFA Champions League triumph last season.\\n\\nAnd who can blame them? After all, the disparity between the two clubs is cavernous.\\n\\nAs well as starting the new season as the reigning European champion, Liverpool finished second in the league last season -- falling just short of Manchester City by a single point in one of the most tightly fought campaigns in the history of the division.\\n\\nAnd let\\'s not forget Liverpool\\'s history. The Reds have won the domestic title 18 times and have been champions on Europe on six occasions. Meanwhile Nowich has spent most of its modern history yo-yoing between the first and second tiers of English football.\\n\\n\"Nobody expected us to go up last season so I guess that puts us in a tricky situation. We are where we are but we didn\\'t expect to be here.\"\\n\\nEuropean champion Liverpool face newly promoted Norwich in the English Premier League opener.\\n\\nGlobal vs. local support\\n\\nReeve has spent six years growing his fan podcast which now boasts over 16,000 YouTube subscribers.\\n\\nThe 21-year-old knows the club more than most having interviewed players both past and present whilst following his team up and down the country.\\n\\nLike many Norwich fans, he is excited to be back with the \"big boys\" this season having watched his side languish in obscurity in recent years and knows exactly what this game means to the wider community.\\n\\n\"You\\'re almost in a little bubble because wherever you go, everyone supports Norwich,\" he added, describing the buzz around the city ahead of the season.\\n\\n\"Norwich is not very well connected so it feels like us against them at times. People don\\'t want us to succeed, so we will try even harder to succeed.\"\\n\\nNorwich, owned by one of Britian\\'s most loved celebrity chefs Delia Smith, has to rely on predominantly local support which cannot compare to Liverpool\\'s global fan base.\\n\\nThe iconic Anfield stadium, with its capacity of just over 54,000, holds almost double Norwich\\'s Carrow Road ground alone but Reeve says being a smaller club offers spectators a \"unique\" experience.\\n\\n\"I think there\\'s a lot of pressure and there\\'s a lot of expectation on players who come to Norwich because for a lot of fans, it\\'s all they\\'ve got and it\\'s all they live for,\" he said.\\n\\nLiverpool Anfield stadium is world famous, holding a 54,074 capacity.\\n\\nNorwich City\\'s historic Carrow Road holds a capacity of 27,244 capacity.\\n\\nTired Liverpool?\\n\\nSince Norwich was last in the EPL, Liverpool has spent millions molding one of the most complete squads in the world.\\n\\nThe Reds spent $226 million on recruiting players ahead of the 2018/2019 season alone and paid agents $57.2 million (£43,795,863) between February 2018 and January 2019 -- the most of any English club in this period.\\n\\nIn comparison, Norwich has never spent more than $12.5 million (£10m) on a single player and has resisted the temptation to splash the cash again this summer, despite netting a potential windfall of more than $206 million for promotion.\\n\\nHowever, one of Liverpool\\'s concerns this season is just how many games they will have to play.\\n\\nAs well as 38 Premier League games and defending its Champions League title, Liverpool will travel to Qatar in December to play in FIFA\\'s Club World Cup tournament. Klopp\\'s team will also compete in two domestic cup competitions -- the FA Cup and League Cup -- while on August 14 play Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup final.\\n\\nnew report by FIFPRO said players such as Sadio Mane, Alisson Becker and Mo Salah -- all of which played international tournaments this summer, hampering their ability to rest -- could be at risk of burnout.\\n\\nKlopp himself has been critical of the season\\'s start date, having already played and lost the Community Shield against Manchester City.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why we start that early. The Premier League is such a wonderful product. It doesn\\'t make sense,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I love football. From my point of view we can play each week but somebody has to think about the players and nobody is doing it.\"\\n\\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is not happy with the EPL schedule.\\n\\nQuiet revolution\\n\\nDespite being unable to compete with Liverpool on a financial basis, Norwich has been undergoing a quiet revolution over the last couple of years.\\n\\nA restructuring of the club\\'s hierarchy, more pertinently the arrival of sporting director Stuart Webber in 2017, has seen a rapid turnaround in the club\\'s fortunes.\\n\\nWebber, who previously worked as Liverpool\\'s director of recruitment, has set about adopting a philosophy that runs through the entire club and out into the wider community.\\n\\nAlong with team manager Daniel Farke, Webber has created a winning mentality that\\'s mirrored the fortunes of his former team Huddersfield -- which he helped promote to the EPL in 2017.\\n\\nEven still, last season was simply not meant to happen and promotion came as very pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\"It means that we\\'re coming up to the Premier League with a squad that a lot of people have written off already,\" added Reeve, admitting last season was a shock.\\n\\n\"I mean, you look at the odds, I think we are second favorites to go down and I think that\\'s probably justified in a way because we\\'ve spent barely spent any money.\"\\n\\nNorwich City manager Daniel Farke has implemented an exciting style of play at the club.\\n\\n\\'Let\\'s show the EPL what we can do\\'\\n\\nCentral to the club\\'s new philosophy is a considered transfer policy which has seen a host of previously unknown players come in and surprise a lot of people.\\n\\nThat approach has seen the likes of Argentine Emi Buendia and Finn Teemu Pukki join the club, both of whom have had a huge impact.\\n\\nStriker Pukki was perhaps the most surprising success, arriving for free before becoming the Championship\\'s top scorer (29 goals) in his first season at Carrow Road, although he\\'s yet to come up against the likes of Liverpool\\'s record signing Virgil van Dijk.\\n\\nMeanwhile, youngsters such as Max Aarons and Jamal Lewis have proved welcome additions to the team having graduated from the youth academy -- an aspect of the club rejuvenated under Webber\\'s watchful eye.\\n\\n\"For me, I think he\\'s [Webber] is a genius,\" added Reeve, who interviewed the 35-year-old on his podcast ahead of the new season.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just been a really slow process but there\\'s always been an end goal and he\\'s always been honest and open with the fans. We don\\'t get that across football nowadays.\"\\n\\nWebber is also realistic about where the team stands but is determined to stick to his plan.\\n\\n\"I\\'m confident we\\'ll give it an unbelievably good go. I really do,\" he told Talk Norwich City podcast.\\n\\n\"I\\'m enjoying all the experts telling us that we need to spend this, you need to do that. It\\'s great because it\\'s the same stuff we were hearing last year. Let\\'s go and prove people wrong, embrace it and enjoy it.\"\\n\\nEmi Buendia was one of Norwich City\\'s best performers last season.\\n\\nGerman influence\\n\\nFarke, also instrumental in implementing the new brand of football, has drawn parallels with counterpart Klopp since moving to English football in 2017.\\n\\nBoth German managers spent time at Borussia Dortmund in the past -- albeit at different times and Farke taking charge of the reserve side -- and both have seemingly energized their current club whilst adopting a friendly approach to the media.\\n\\nAs a result, Klopp will be facing some of his former players on Friday, with the likes of Mario Vrancic, Marco Stiepermann and Moritz Leitner likely to feature for Norwich.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a really interesting story, pretty much all German managers who work in England managed at Borussia Dortmund, that\\'s really funny,\" Klopp told Optus Sport\\n\\n\"He\\'s [Farke] doing an incredible job.\"\\n\\nNorwich City won the Championship, England\\'s second divison, last season.\\n\\nReeve hopes the energetic and attacking brand of football that Norwich has now adopted will give his side a chance against a Liverpool side expected to be firm challengers for every competition this season.\\n\\nLet\\'s not forget that the last time Liverpool played Norwich at home on the first day of the season, the Reds went on to win the league.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go there and let\\'s show the world what we\\'re about,\" Reeve added.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s play the football we played last season, football that took us up as champions by some distance and was so successful and let\\'s show the English Premier League what we can do.\"', 'summary': '(CNN) When the world tunes in for Friday\\'s curtain raiser of this season\\'s English Premier League , they will be witnessing a true baptism of fire.\\nEuropean champion Liverpool face newly promoted Norwich in the English Premier League opener.\\nAs well as 38 Premier League games and defending its Champions League title, Liverpool will travel to Qatar in December to play in FIFA\\'s Club World Cup tournament.\\nThe Premier League is such a wonderful product.\\n\"Let\\'s play the football we played last season, football that took us up as champions by some distance and was so successful and let\\'s show the English Premier League what we can do.\"', 'keywords': ['english', 'spent', 'team', 'players', 'league', 'opener', 'premier', 'season', 'football', 'liverpool', 'faces', 'norwich', 'club']}"

Eyes that were gazing dreamily over the rolling English countryside are now focused on the scrap between the mount of popular jockey Frankie Dettori and Japanese outsider Deirdre.\\n\\nThe red, white and blue silks seem to merge in a flash of color and as they duel to the line. The gentle hubbub from the stands builds into a roar. British cut-glass accents switch to guttural urgings. Panama hats and ladies\\' bonnets nod like wild flowers in the wind as they exhort their favorite for one last push.\\n\\nStride by stride, the charging Deirdre -- ridden by jockey Oisin Murphy -- hunts down Dettori\\'s front-running Mehdaayih. She surges up the inside nearest the rail, and when the white flash on her nose draws alongside she accelerates again. To groans from the Dettori faithful, she scores a famous victory for Japan to land the £600,000 ($728,000) Nassau Stakes, first staged in 1840.\\n\\nBack in the stands, Ladies\\' Day is in full swing at a sun-kissed Qatar Goodwood Festival, more commonly known as \"Glorious Goodwood,\" the traditional finale to Britain\\'s social season.\\n\\nOisin Murphy and Deirdre (left) overhaul Frankie Dettori on Mehdaayih at Goodwood.\\n\\n\\'Glorious\\'\\n\\nThe \"glorious\" moniker was added by the Victorian press, but as well as being handy alliteration it perfectly encapsulates the feeling as your eyes look out across the hilltop racecourse and take in the lush landscape of woods, fields and folds of the Sussex Downs in the far south of England.

The meeting grew thanks to a combination of its setting, society scene, and proximity to London. King Edward VII was a regular visitor from the 1860s and dubbed it \"a garden party with racing tacked on.\"\\n\\nStill on a high after a truly remarkable five days...only 358 days until we can do it all again!

In the latter half of the 19th century, huge amounts of people went to Scotland to enjoy the sport, while some headed south to Cowes for the sailing regatta.\\n\\n\"Does the season still exist?

Before long, Johnson is going to have to face up to this reality.\\n\\nAt a glance, Johnson\\'s Brexit plan is simpler than May\\'s: get a new agreement with the EU or crash out on October 31 with no deal. Given that the EU has said numerous times that May\\'s deal, formally known at the Withdrawal Agreement, is not open for renegotiation, no deal seems on the cards.\\n\\nThe snag for Johnson is that among those rejected Brexit alternatives was, you guessed it, no deal. On paper, that leaves the UK in what would be commonly called a constitutional crisis.\\n\\nThe UK is unlike most Western nations in that it has no written constitution. Instead, it relies on constitutional precedent and convention set out in law or previous acts of Parliament.\\n\\nHowever, Brexit has thrown up so many political abnormalities that with no precedent or written constitution to fall back on, the political class has started trying to make it up as it goes along.\\n\\n\"The problem is that there are numerous things going on with the constitution, and a lot of it in new, completely untested areas,\" says Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government. \"Even though certain things are written down in law about what happens when, how it actually happens is untested territory.\"\\n\\nThis constitutional ambiguity has led to an almighty row about what should happen next.\\n\\nWhen Parliament returns from its summer holiday on September 3, Johnson could well face a motion of no confidence in his government.\\n\\nIt\\'s a vote that Johnson and his team can\\'t expect to win. He currently has a parliamentary majority of just one. And some of his own Conservative lawmakers have implied they will put blocking no deal ahead of party loyalty.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Here\\'s what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here\\'s what you need to know about Brexit 03:13\\n\\nHowever, losing this vote wouldn\\'t mean that Johnson gets stopped in his tracks. Nor would it mean that no deal is automatically avoided.\\n\\nAfter losing a confidence vote, the sitting government by law has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of the House of Commons and resume governing. If it fails to do so, then an early general election is called. Until the result of that election, a caretaker government (probably the sitting government) runs the country.\\n\\nThe problem with all of the above is that the law on which it relies, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, only came into being in 2011, meaning there is no precedent in using it to kick out a government. \"While it (the FTPA) tells us about a procedure whereby an early election can take place, it doesn\\'t help with the nitty gritty, like when does the government have to go and how do you replace it,\" says Andrew Blick of the UK\\'s Constitutional Society.\\n\\nThe law itself doesn\\'t specify exactly when this election would have to take place. This means that, despite losing a confidence vote, Johnson would effectively be able to sit in Downing Street for weeks, if not months.\\n\\nEven under normal circumstances, a caretaker government would be far from ideal in a nation used to governments with clear parliamentary majorities. But with the Brexit deadline looming, the UK faces an autumn crunch point.\\n\\nThe next EU Council Summit takes place on October 17 -- two weeks before Brexit day. It is, currently, the only chance the UK has to delay Brexit and avoid no deal. It would be up to whoever is leading the government at this point to represent the UK. If that person is Johnson, it would be solely in his gift to request an extension. Should he opt not to, then May\\'s deal remains unratified in London and Brussels, meaning the clock runs out and it\\'s all over.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Polish in London weigh in on Brexit (2016) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Polish in London weigh in on Brexit (2016) 02:25\\n\\nNot everyone agrees that this is the only outcome. Dominic Grieve, the UK\\'s former attorney general, thinks that, given the unprecedented crisis, lawmakers should try to form a cross-party caretaker government of national unity during the 14 day-period after Johnson loses a confidence vote.\\n\\nThis caretaker government would be able to request a Brexit extension from the EU, possibly by letter, giving the UK time for an election and to get its house in order. Unfortunately for Grieve, this too is entirely without precedent and relies on constitutional norms being made up on the spot. All the while, it would be perfectly legal for Johnson to remain in power, running down the Brexit timer.\\n\\nEven if Johnson does choose to sit tight, some lawmakers believe they can force his hand to delay Brexit. In recent days, those opposed to no deal have pointed to something called the Cabinet Manual, which advises a caretaker government on what it should and shouldn\\'t do.\\n\\nOnce crucial observation it makes is that a caretaker government doesn\\'t have the confidence of the House of Commons. Therefore, as Haddon points out, one way it could be interpreted is that a caretaker government would be \"restricted in what they can do and ought to act in the national interest with the opposition parties.\"\\n\\nHowever, even this is just guidance. And as the chairman of Johnson\\'s Conservative Party said recently, any government headed up by Johnson is \"not going to initiate a general election\" before October 31. So, no deal\\'s back on the cards.\\n\\nWithout a written constitution and no precedent for guidance, this all becomes a political battleground. In recent weeks, all sorts of wild suggestions have been made.\\n\\nSome have even suggested that the Queen, the UK\\'s conventionally apolitical head of state, could get involved.\\n\\nHowever ludicrous this seems, Blick says that \"the only firm legal position in all of this is that, in theory, the Queen appoints and can dismiss a prime minister.\"\\n\\nAnd as Blick points out, \"because there are such sharply diverging interpretations being advanced, it could become harder for the politicians to sort this out between themselves ... I\\'m sure the palace is concerned by this.\"\\n\\nFrom squatting prime ministers to a writing letters to the EU and the Queen sacking Boris Johnson, Brexit can feel pretty surreal. However, with absolutely nothing to guide the UK\\'s politicians through this mess, it\\'s hard to see squabbling lawmakers ending this nightmare any time soon.\\n\\nAnd just as three years ago leaving the EU without a deal seemed far-fetched, only a fool would rule anything out at this point.', 'summary': \"London (CNN) Boris Johnson, the UK's new Prime Minister, has inherited an unprecedented constitutional mess from his predecessor, Theresa May.\\nOn paper, that leaves the UK in what would be commonly called a constitutional crisis.\\nInstead, it relies on constitutional precedent and convention set out in law or previous acts of Parliament.\\nUnfortunately for Grieve, this too is entirely without precedent and relies on constitutional norms being made up on the spot.\\nFrom squatting prime ministers to a writing letters to the EU and the Queen sacking Boris Johnson, Brexit can feel pretty surreal.\", 'keywords': ['brexit', 'uks', 'uk', 'eu', 'confidence', 'johnson', 'election', 'cant', 'constitutional', 'proper', 'crisis', 'deal', 'caretaker']}"
